Given an unsorted array Arr[] of N integers and an integer X, find floor and ceiling of X in Arr[0..N-1].

Floor of X is the largest element which is smaller than or equal to X. Floor of X doesn’t exist if X is smaller than smallest element of Arr[].

Ceil of X is the smallest element which is greater than or equal to X. Ceil of X doesn’t exist if X is greater than greatest element of Arr[].

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8, X = 7
Arr[] = {5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 5, 6}
Output: 6 8
Explanation:
Floor of 7 is 6 and ceil of 7 
is 8.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 8, X = 10
Arr[] = {5, 6, 8, 9, 6, 5, 5, 6}
Output: 9 -1
Explanation:
Floor of 10 is 9 but ceil of 10 is not 
possible.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getFloorAndCeil() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns a pair of integers denoting the answer. Return -1 if floor or ceil is not present.
